# MUWP: Aptos Integration

MUWP leverages Aptos to offer advanced cross-chain transaction capabilities, enhancing the Aptos ecosystem with seamless token swaps across various blockchains.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Swaps:** Utilize bridges and decentralized exchanges (DEXes) for efficient asset transfers.
- **Aptos Smart Contracts:** Employ Aptos's smart contract platform for secure, complex transactions.
- **AI-Driven Optimization:** Optimize swap routes using AI for the best transaction rates.

## Technical Strategy

### 1) Smart Contract Development Using Aptos

#### Purpose
Develop and deploy Aptos smart contracts to handle complex operations like route optimization and token swaps.

#### Snippets of Smart Contract Implementation in Move:

```move
module SwapModule {

  // Struct representing a swap request with additional information for clarity
  struct SwapRequest has key {
    from_token: address,  // Address of the token to swap from
    to_token: address,    // Address of the token to swap to
    amount: u64,           // Amount of the from_token to swap
  }

  // Public function to initiate a swap based on a SwapRequest
  public fun execute_swap(account: &signer, request: &SwapRequest) {

    // Fetch real-time prices for both tokens using a reliable price feed
    let from_price: u64 = get_price(account, &request.from_token);
    let to_price: u64 = get_price(account, &request.to_token);

    // Calculate the best swap route based on the retrieved prices (implementation details below)
    let best_route: vector<u8> = find_best_route(account, &request.from_token, &request.to_token, from_price, to_price);

    // Execute the swap on the chosen DEX or bridge based on the best route (implementation details below)
    execute_swap_on_route(account, &request.from_token, &request.to_token, request.amount, &best_route);
  }

  // Private helper function to fetch the price of a token using a reliable price feed service
  private fun get_price(account: &signer, token: &address): u64 {
    // Leverage a trusted price feed module or oracle to retrieve the latest price
    let price_feed_contract: &PriceFeed = borrow_resource::borrow<PriceFeed>(account, &PRICE_FEED_ADDRESS);
    let price = price_feed_contract.get_price(token);
    return price;
  }

  // Placeholder functions for core swap functionalities (implementation details not shown here)
  private fun find_best_route(account: &signer, from_token: &address, to_token: &address, from_price: u64, to_price: u64): vector<u8>;
  private fun execute_swap_on_route(account: &signer, from_token: &address, to_token: &address, amount: u64, route: &vector<u8>);
}

// Resource declaration for the price feed module (assuming it exists in a separate module)
const PRICE_FEED_ADDRESS: address;

module PriceFeedModule {
  // Struct representing a price record with a timestamp for tracking updates
  struct PriceRecord has key {
    token: address,
    price: u64,
    timestamp: u64,
  }

  // Public function for retrieving the latest price of a token
  public fun get_price(account: &signer, token: &address): u64 {
    // Implement logic to fetch and return the latest price record for the given token
    let price_record = get_latest_price_record(account, token);
    return price_record.price;
  }

  // Private function for retrieving the latest price record (implementation details not shown)
  private fun get_latest_price_record(account: &signer, token: &address): PriceRecord;
}

```

This code defines the module for token swaps and price feeds on the Aptos network, providing functions to execute swaps and fetch token prices based on real-time data.

**Explanation:**

* **SwapRequest Struct:** The `SwapRequest` struct includes information like `from_token`, `to_token`, and `amount` for clarity.
* **`execute_swap` Function:**
    * The function retrieves prices from a reliable price feed module using `get_price`.
    * It calculates the best swap route using a placeholder function `find_best_route`. This function would likely involve querying DEXes or Bridges for optimal swap paths based on prices (not implemented here). 
    * It executes the swap on the chosen route using a placeholder function `execute_swap_on_route`. This function would interact with the chosen DEX or bridge to perform the actual token swap (not implemented here).
* **`get_price` Function:**
    * This function retrieves the price of a token from a trusted price feed module or oracle service using a borrow operation. 
    *  The `PRICE_FEED_ADDRESS` constant would be replaced with the actual address of the deployed price feed module contract.
* **Price Feed Module:**
    * The `PriceRecord` struct now includes a `timestamp` field to track price updates.
    * The `get_price`

### 2) Cross-Contract Calls

#### Purpose
Leverage Aptosâ€™s capability to interact with other contracts for functionalities like price fetching or liquidity checks:

```move
module LiquidityModule {
    struct LiquidityInfo has key {
        token_a: address,
        token_b: address,
        amount_a: u64,
        amount_b: u64,
    }

    public fun add_liquidity(account: &signer, token_a: address, token_b: address, amount_a: u64, amount_b: u64) {
        // Details for adding liquidity
    }

    public fun execute_trade(account: &signer, token_a: address, token_b: address, amount: u64) {
        let required_liquidity = LiquidityModule::add_liquidity(account, token_a, token_b, amount, amount);
        // Additional trading logic after liquidity is ensured
    }
}
```
This code defines a module named `LiquidityModule` for managing liquidity pools in your Aptos application. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

**1. Struct Definition:**

* `LiquidityInfo` struct: This struct serves as a blueprint for storing information about liquidity pools. It has four fields:
    * `token_a`: Address of the first token in the liquidity pool.
    * `token_b`: Address of the second token in the liquidity pool.
    * `amount_a`: The total amount of `token_a` currently deposited in the pool.
    * `amount_b`: The total amount of `token_b` currently deposited in the pool.

**2. Public Functions:**

* **`add_liquidity`:**
    * This public function allows users to add liquidity to a pool. It takes five arguments:
        * `account`: The signer account initiating the liquidity addition.
        * `token_a`: Address of the first token being added.
        * `token_b`: Address of the second token being added.
        * `amount_a`: The amount of `token_a` the user wants to add.
        * `amount_b`: The amount of `token_b` the user wants to add.
    * The specific details of adding liquidity (e.g., user approval, token transfers) are not implemented within this function but would be filled in the actual implementation.

* **`execute_trade`:**
    * This public function likely represents the core trading functionality. It takes four arguments:
        * `account`: The signer account initiating the trade.
        * `token_a`: Address of the first token involved in the trade.
        * `token_b`: Address of the second token involved in the trade.
        * `amount`: The amount of `token_a` (presumably) being offered in the trade.
    *  it calls the `add_liquidity` function with the same amount for both `token_a` and `token_b`. T design choice where the trading functionality might ensure there's enough liquidity in the pool before proceeding with the trade itself. However, the actual trading logic after adding liquidity is not implemented within this function but would be filled in the complete solution.


### 3) Integration with DEXes and Bridges

- **DEXes:** Directly integrate with Aptos DEXes through their APIs to perform trades.
- **Bridges:** Use Allbridge and similar services to facilitate swaps involving non-Aptos tokens.

#### Aptos Elements Needed:
- **Aptos API:** Interact with Aptos's blockchain for transaction submissions and account monitoring.
- **Aptos Node:** Muwpay would interact with the Aptos network through an Aptos node. This node allows Muwpay to submit transactions (like swap requests) to the network, query data from the blockchain ledger, and participate in the consensus process.
- **Move Librairies** 

### Conclusion:
This integration strategy outlines how MUWP can leverage these DEXes and bridges to enhance its platform's capabilities, offering a versatile, efficient, and user-focused service in the Aptos DeFi space.
